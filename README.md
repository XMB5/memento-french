- secondary subs
- don't hide subs/hide bottom toolbar when term is open and mouse not on term
- better phrases/idiom recongition?
- anki integration
- subtitle theming options
- play from command line with mpv options
- clean up code

## Building

**I do not guarantee that any branch will successfully build or be bug-free.** 
**If you want to build a stable version of Memento, compile a [release](https://github.com/ripose-jp/Memento/releases) from source.**

### Linux

To install Memento on Linux, type the following commands:

```
make
sudo make install
```

### Windows

1. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
1. Open **MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit**
1. (Optional, may break things if MSYS2 is buggy) Make sure MSYS2 is up to date by running these commands:
    ```
    pacman -Sy --needed msys2-runtime pacman
    pacman -Su
    ```
1. Install the necessary tools and dependencies:
    ```
    pacman -S git make mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg mingw-w64-x86_64-sqlite3 mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-mpv mingw-w64-x86_64-mecab mingw-w64-x86_64-json-c mingw-w64-x86_64-libzip
    ```

    ```
1. Build Memento:
    ```
    cd Memento
    ./windows-build.sh x86_64
    ```
1. The resulting file will be in
    ```
    build/Memento_x86_64
    ```

### Mac OS X

**Important Note:** The OS X version of Memento has a myriad of problems that make it
unusable for casual use. This build guide is intended for OS X developers interested
in fixing the OS X port of Memento. Check this [issue](https://github.com/ripose-jp/Memento/issues/7) 
for a list of confirmed bugs or to contribute new bugs.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with this command:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
1. Install the necessary tools and dependencies:
   ```
   brew install git cmake gcc ffmpeg sqlite3 qt5 mpv mecab mecab-ipadic json-c libzip
   ```
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ripose-jp/Memento.git
   ```
1. Build Memento:
   ```
   cd memento
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```
1. The resulting executable will be:
   ```
   memento/build/src/memento
   ```

## Configuration

Most mpv shaders, plugins, and configuration files will work out of the box.
The Memento config directory is located at:

### Linux
```
~/.config/memento
```

### Windows
```
[installation directory]\config
```

### Mac OS X
```
~/.config/memento
```

If any mpv binds or plugins do not work, please create an issue in the issue
tracker.
